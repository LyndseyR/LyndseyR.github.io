        <p>I did a hackaton with 2 Java students. We put together a game with 20 questions and stored them in a database. To challenge myself after the Hackathon I ran the questions through JavaScript. </p>

        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>At the halfway point in our 12 week program we did a hackathon with the Java cohort going on simultainously with my class. I was paired with two Java Students and we were tasked with developing anything fitting the topic "Get Your Game On."</p>

        <div class="weak">
          <p>Weaknesses</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Had to learn what the other side does</li>
            <li>Had 3 days to put together a game</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="opp">
          <p>Opportunities</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Was able to observe how the back end worked (on a microscale)</li>
            <li>We created something functional</li>
            <li>Was able to be really creative and playful within the design</li>
          </ul>

        <p>This was my favorite tasks we were given at The Iron Yard. My team and I worked extremely well together. We spent 3 days sitting in the same area brainstorming, creating sketches and style guides. As they worked I picked up on new lingo that I had never been introduced to before. Like what databases did and inputing data through url's. I learned things about Git for instance, how to get out of the white screen of death that I had been getting trapped on since week one. This project was a very simple design and because it was more for learning I realized I could do the whole project in JavaScript. This is what I did after the weekend was over.</p>
