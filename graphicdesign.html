        <h2>Graphic Design Experience</h2>
        <!-- <a href="#">Live Site</a> &nbsp;|&nbsp; <a href="#">View Code</a> -->
        <p>I received my degree in Graphic Design from Gardner Webb University. After college I worked at a weekly newspaper in Woodruff South Carolina for six months until they closed for financial reasons. From there I went to Columbia South Carolina where I was on a team of in house graphic designers. My role was primarly email marketing and product imagery. I would also do print pieces when our schedule we were spread thin.</p>

        <h2>Email Marketing</h2>
        <p>I would send up to 10 emails a week to different segmented practices. They Ranged from promotional blasts which backed our printed materials, to drug alerts, to service updates. I was a part of a team that implemented a new email segmentation system, Pardot. With this upgrade we now had valuable marketing information. I designed automated emails that backed the campaigns set up to go to active customers when they; abandoned their cart, went to a service page, filled out a contact form. Our emails are usually all segmented and maintatined using dynamic lists. The customers I email are broken up into 5 groups.</p>

        <h2>Product Photography</h2>
        <p>Eighty percent of our imagery was taken in-house. The company sold over 6,000 products on the Web and I photographed over 3,500 products. To best display the product, most of the shots are taken at a straight on angle. Some were taken specifically for a promotional pieces which allowed for more creativity.</p>

        <h2>Web Graphics</h2>
        <p>Our banners on our site, <a href="sasrx.com">SASrx.com</a> reflected our print promotions. These promotional periods ranged from 2-6 weeks. I was in charge of making sure the web was always in synch with our printed materials. I was given the product and content and would have to create a slider banner that would display on the home page matching the messaging from the printed pieces. Once the banners would be completed graphically I then had to go into the code and set them. Simultainously I created landing pages to show all our current promotions in one place. </p>
