        <h2>Graphic Design Experience</h2>
        <!-- <a href="#">Live Site</a> &nbsp;|&nbsp; <a href="#">View Code</a> -->
        <p>I received my degree in Graphic Design from Gardner Webb University. After college I worked at a weekly newspaper in Woodruff, South Carolina for six months until they closed due to financial reasons. From there I went to Columbia, South Carolina where I was with a team of three designers. My role was primarly email marketing and product imagery. I would also do mailers when our print designers were spread thin.</p>

        <h2>Email Marketing</h2>
        <p>I would send up to 10 emails a week to different segmented practices. They ranged from promotional blasts which backed our printed materials, to drug alerts, to service updates. Our emails are usually all segmented and maintained using dynamic lists. The customers I would email were broken up into 5 groups. </p>
        <p>I was a part of a team that implemented a new email segmentation system, Pardot. With this upgrade we now had valuable marketing information. I designed automated emails that backed campaigns to email customers when they; abandoned their cart, went to a service page, filled out a contact form. It was incredibly rewarding seeing a direct monetary effect from the emails I created. I felt proud to be having a positive effect for the company. </p>

        <h2>Product Photography</h2>
        <p>Eighty percent of our imagery was taken in-house. The company sold over 6,000 products on the Web and I photographed around 3,500 products, using the Orterly Light Box. To best display the product, most of the shots are taken at a straight on angle. Some were taken specifically for promotional pieces which allowed for more creativity (like the glove shot displayed at the top of the page).</p>

        <h2>Web Graphics</h2>
        <p>Our banners on our site, <a href="sasrx.com">SASrx.com</a> reflected our print promotions. These promotional periods ranged from 2-6 weeks. I was in charge of making sure the web was always in synch with our printed materials. I was given the product and content and would have to create a slider banner that would display on the home page matching the messaging from the printed pieces. Once the banners would be completed and approved, I then had to go into the code and set them. Simultainously I created landing pages to show all our current promotions in one place. </p>

        <h2>Print Material</h2>
        <p>The mailer is an example of a piece I created in my first months at Southern Anesthesia. It was an amazing opportunity to understand how to design within a set brand standard. The Fourth of July was the cover for the newspaper special that was included with the papers during that week. </p>
