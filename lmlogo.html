        <p>When thinking of how to brand myself it started with a logo, and boy was it a long evolving process.</p>

          <h2>Process</h2>
          <p> I started the process by making a wordlist of actions or adjectivies that captured my individuality. A water theme kept coming up, which made sense because a huge part of my life was swimming. I started the sport when I was 8 and it took me through college. I am who I am today because of the life lessons the sport taught me. I had an idea to create a water pattern in the background. I created the design in Illustrator using the symbol tool. Although I really liked the concept when it came to place my initals over the design it no longer flowed.</p>
          <p>The next idea I had took me down a rabbit hole. I tried using my initials to create a swimmer diving off the block. The problem was twofold. One, to anyone but a swimmer the shape was completely random. Two, the design was so abstract my initials were unrecognizable. This wasn't a deal breaker but I began to think how is this going to help me. Swimming is my past, but does that make it relevant for my present? </p>
          <p>Which lead me to brainstorming with some classmates at The Iron Yard. We took it to the whiteboard. As you can see from the picture of the whiteboard we simply keep writing out my initials in a variety of ways. I love history and structures. When I went back into Illustrator and started recreating some of the whiteboard iterations the LM shaped as columns immediately spoke to me. This is a solid structure, durable and minimalistic. All adjectivies that express who I am at the core.   </p>
