        <p>I'm obessed with coding, books, history, popcorn, squirrels, swimming and traveling. I'm one of those annoying people that always trys to find the positive and my sense of humor usually has me laughing constantly.  Social media, having to navigate or run any distance over a quarter mile leaves me exhausted.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I've always had a passion for layouts and design, which is why I majored in Graphic Design at Gardner Webb University. I worked as a Graphic Designer for four years at a medical distribution company. Almost immediately since graduating I have been attempting to self-teach myself web design. However everything I learned felt random and I never felt confident in how it all connected. Which lead me to The Iron Yard.</p>
        <p>Here at The Iron Yard I've spent 12 weeks dedicating 60 hours a week to learning UI design. All the random puzzle pieces I had in my head from the years of self teaching have come together. It's been an incredible experince one that I would recommend to anyone who is passionate about coding. </p>
        <p>It's almost impossible for me not to give 100%. This comes from a combination of being a competive swimmer and my faith. I started swimming when I was 8 and was fortunate to be offered a scholarship to compete at a Divison I school. Having to balance academics and competeing at a collegiate level for four years shaped my work ethic and my ability to prioritize. My faith also plays a huge role in defining me. I have everything and I deserve nothing. This constant thought keeps me humble. I don't know why I'm blessed, but I've been given certain skills and am determined everyday not to waste an opportunity.</p>
        <p>Once you get to know me you'll see why people describe me as 'Determined', 'Solid' and sometimes 'Stubborn' because I can never give up.</p>
